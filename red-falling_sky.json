"Paroles de la chanson Falling Sky par Red\r\nNow it falls all around me\nDid I think I could run away?\nNow it's coming to find me\nThis war that I deserve\nNow it burns across this shattered earth\nI lift my eyes to fire\n\nUnder a falling sky\nHopeless, there's nowhere to hide\nThe terror is real this time\nUnder a falling sky\nI'm under, I'm under\nA falling sky\n\nThere you are, so far away\nDid you think I was fighting you?\n\nI only wanted to carry you\nSo far away from here\nThe nightmare bleeds\nThe poison seeps\nI hear you call\nYou're screaming, screaming\n\nUnder a falling sky\nHopeless, there's nowhere to hide\nThe terror is real this time\nUnder a falling sky\nI'm under, I'm under\nA falling sky\n\nMy fate it rains, it rains like cinders\nThe cadence drums, the war it comes\nGrowing thunder, terror, wonder\nFalling, falling\n\nIt's falling, falling\n\nUnder a falling sky\nThe terror is real this time\nIt's over now, it's over\nNOW!\nThe terror is real!\n\nI'm under, I'm under\nA falling sky\nUnder a falling sky\nI'm falling, I'm falling\nThe terror is real this time\nI'm falling, I'm falling\nUnder a falling sky\nI'm falling, I'm falling\nI'm under..."
