"Paroles de la chanson Valley of Death par Skillet\r\nDays in darkness rolling by\nAnd how the years betray us\nAnd our dreams escape us\nThe world I wanted turned to night\nLove became a shadow\nWhere did the time go?\n\nSomeone said this is all part of the plan\nBut I don't understand\n\nNow that I walk through the valley of death\nYou're the light to guide me\nWhen I'm lost and can't see\nI'm holding on with all the strength I can\nSay you won't forget me\n'Cause sometimes I don't believe\n\nThat I am not alone in the valley of death\n\nLove and laughter turn to tears\nWhat will come tomorrow?\nIs it joy or sorrow?\nMemories fading through the years\nNow I've got some smile lines\nWe've had some good times\n\nI can't help wondering how much time is left\n'Cause I'm not ready yet\n\nNow that I walk through the valley of death\nYou're the light to guide me\nWhen I'm lost and can't see\nI'm holding on with all the strength I can\nSay you won't forget me\n'Cause sometimes I don't believe\n\nThat I am not alone in the valley of death\n\nWhen I can't carry on\nEnter into the unknown\nWhen I'm with you where I belong\nWhen the night's too hard to take\nAnd the starlight starts to fade\nCome and find me, I need to be saved\nBefore it's too late\n\nNow that I walk through the valley of death\nYou're the light to guide me\nWhen I'm lost and can't see\nI'm holding on with all the strength I can\nSay you won't forget me\n'Cause sometimes I don't believe (I don't believe)\n\n\nNow that I walk through the valley of death (Through the valley of death)\nYou're the light to guide me (To guide me)\nWhen I'm lost can't see (I can't see)\nI'm holding on with all the strength I can (With the strength that I can)\nSay you won't forget me (Forget me)\n'Cause sometimes I don't believe (I don't believe)\nThat I am not alone (I am not alone)\nThat I am not alone (I am not alone)\nThat I am not alone\nIn the valley of death"
