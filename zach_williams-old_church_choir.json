"Paroles de la chanson Old Church Choir par Zach Williams\r\nThere's revival, and it's spreading\nLike a wildfire in my heart\nA Sunday morning, Hallelujah\nAnd it's lasting all week long\n\nCan you hear it ?\nCan you feel it ?\nIt's the rhythm of a gospel song\nOh once you choose it, you can't lose it\nThere ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\n\nI've got an Old Church Choir singing in my soul\nI've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful\nI've got a heart overflowing 'cause I've been restored\n\nThere ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\nNo there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\n\nWhen the valleys, that I wander\nTurn to mountains, that I can't climb\nOh, You are with me, never leave me\nOh 'cause, there ain't nothing there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\n\nI've got an Old Church Choir singing in my soul\nI've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful\nI've got a heart overflowing 'cause I've been restored\nThere ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\nNo there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\n\nClap your hands and stomp your feet\n'Til you find that gospel beat\n\n'Cause He's all you'll ever need\nAll you'll ever need\n\nClap your hands and stomp your feet\n'Til you find that gospel beat\n'Cause He's all you'll ever need\nAll you'll ever need\n\nI've got an old church choir, singing in my soul\nI've got a sweet salvation, and it's beautiful\n\nI've got an Old Church Choir singing in my soul\nI've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful\nI've got a heart overflowing 'cause I've been restored\nThere ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\nNo there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy\nOh there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy"
